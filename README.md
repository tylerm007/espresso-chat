A sample application built on top of Logic Designer.

Generated API, Rules, & Security
=============
Logic Designer deploys an API for the schemas defined in a project space based the relationships found in the database. Espresso Chat builds on Designer, and demos how quickly a handful of rules can simplify a reasonably complex application. It also provides workable samples for custom authentication, endpoint security, and what an application interface for the API might look like.
